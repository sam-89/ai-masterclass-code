# Week 01 — Start Here

Welcome! This repo is organized into week-by-week folders. Each week typically includes:

- a `README.md` explaining the goal
- a `main.py` you can run
- any `data/` inputs and `out/` outputs

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ recommended
- A terminal (PowerShell, Terminal, etc.)

## Quick Python check

Run the following to confirm Python is installed and working:

```bash
python --version
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

If `python` isn’t found, try `py` on Windows:

```powershell
py --version
py -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

## Next

Go to **Week 02** to set up a virtual environment and run your first script:

- `01-python/week-02-setup/`
